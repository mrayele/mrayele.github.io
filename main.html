	<h1>It Works!</h1>
	<p>Anyone who's ever written HTML before knows that this is not the intended final version of the website. However, I decided I wanted to add something to this default 'success' page (which will load if my domain is successfully attached to this repository) because I just cannot stand a standard, CSS-less h1 alone.</p>
	<p>Too often I have seen that same message ("It works!") displayed on my localhost and it has represented varying degrees of truth. So for this website, I am adding two paragraphs of HTML. Maybe this is helpful; maybe you have just wasted ~3 minutes of your life reading it. Who knows?</p>
	<p>But the important thing is, if you are reading this, I've used a domain I bought with GitHub pages and it was successful. I'm no fortune teller, but I assume as I try to expand this website I'll see this page a few more times when it does't work. Such is life.</p>
